#Vehicle to Vehicle Communication  
-----

Yo all !!

Managing the traffic these days is becoming more challenging day by day due to increase in number of vehicles and things like that. So we decided to make an attempt to solve this problem. 
So our basic philosophy behind the solution of this problem was that : A task can be executed more efficiently if the entities working out the task have a very good co-ordination among themselves.
Considering this problem the task was to manage traffic effectively an the entities were the cars(vehicles). 
So we praepared a system which comprised of a area specific server and cars which hada decice via which it can communicate with the server.
